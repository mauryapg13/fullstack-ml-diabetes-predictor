## Features

-   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** In-depth analysis and visualization of the PIMA Indians Diabetes Database.
-   **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values (imputation) and standardized features for optimal model performance.
-   **Multi-Model Training:** Trained and evaluated several classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Utilized `GridSearchCV` to find the optimal parameters for the best-performing model (XGBoost).
-   **Reusable ML Pipeline:** Encapsulated the entire preprocessing and prediction workflow into a single, robust `scikit-learn` Pipeline.
-   **REST API:** Deployed the trained pipeline as a RESTful API using **Flask**, making the model accessible for predictions via web requests.
-   **Interactive Web Interface:** Built a user-friendly front-end with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** that allows users to input patient data and receive real-time predictions from the API.

## How to Run

Once the setup is complete, you can run the application with the following steps:

1.  **Start the Flask API server:**
    Open a terminal and run the `app.py` script.
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
    You should see a message indicating the server is running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`.

2.  **Launch the web interface:**
    Navigate to your project directory and open the `index.html` file in your favorite web browser.
